        <h1>Tzatziki Dip</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Otherwise known as that yogurt and cucumber sauce you love at Greek restaurants but worry about mispronouncing</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Learn how to make tzatziki, a traditional Greek yogurt and cucumber sauce with fresh herbs. 
            Tzatziki is a refreshing sauce or dip, and it’s so easy to make! This basic recipe yields about 2 ½ cups; multiply if necessary.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 Cups grated cucumber</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups plain Greek yogurt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint and/or dill</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 medium clove of garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <P>
            <ol>
                <li>Working with one big handful at a time, lightly squeeze the grated cucumber between your palms over the sink to remove excess moisture. Transfer the squeezed cucumber to a serving bowl, and repeat with the remaining cucumber.</li>
                <li>Add the yogurt, olive oil, herbs, lemon juice, garlic, and salt to the bowl, and stir to blend. Let the mixture rest for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Taste and add additional chopped fresh herbs, lemon juice, and/or salt, if necessary (I thought this batch was just right as-is).</li>
                <li>Serve tzatziki immediately or chill for later. Leftover tzatziki keeps well, chilled, for about 4 days.</li>
            </ol>
