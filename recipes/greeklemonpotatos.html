        <h1>Lemon Potatos</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Perfect golden brown potatos with a lemon zing!</p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Definitely a cut above the usual roasted potatoes! The unique thing about Greek Lemon Potatoes is that they are cooked in a heavily flavoured lemon garlic broth so they suck up all that flavour before roasting to golden perfection. They’re utterly addictive!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1.2 kg / 2.5lb potatoes</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups chicken stock/broth</li>
                <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1/3 cup lemon juice</li>
                <li>5 garlic cloves</li>
                <li>1 tbsp dried oregano</li>
                <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <P>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°Cfan).</li>
                <li>Cut potatoes: Peel potatoes and cut large ones into thick wedges – about 3cm / 1.2" thick – and medium ones into 3 (see photo in post).</li>
                <li>Coat potatoes: Place potatoes in a roasting pan with all the other ingredients. Toss well.</li>
                <li>Roast 45 minutes: Roast for 20 minutes. Turn potatoes, roast for a further 25 to 30 minutes until the liquid is mostly absorbed by potatoes/evaporated and you're left with mainly oil in the pan.</li>
                <li>To crisp the potatoes (optional): Transfer potatoes to a separate tray. (Note 3) Tilt the original roasting pan and scoop off as much of the oil as you can (some juices is ok), then drizzle over the potatoes.</li>
                <li>Roast 35 minutes: Transfer potatoes to oven and roast for 35 – 40 minutes, turning once or twice, until potatoes are golden and a bit crispy on the edges</li>
                <li>Heat pan juices: Return pan #1 with the garlic juices to the oven for the last 5 – 10 minutes or so to reduce down and make the garlic golden. (Optional, Note 4)</li>
                <li>Plate up: Transfer potatoes to serving platter. Drizzle over the reduced garlic pan juices (or toss potatoes in the pan). Serve, garnished with lemon wedges and oregano if desired.</li>
            </ol>
        </P>
        <h3>Recipe Notes</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li> Potatoes – use starchy, not waxy potatoes, as they absorb flavour better.</li>
                <li>Braising liquid – Can use water + 2 stock cubes or 2 tsp powder instead, but liquid stock is tastier. Can use veg stock instead of chicken.</li>
                <li>Garlic – it’s best to use a microplane to finely grate the garlic so it dissolves in the stock so you don’t end up with burnt little garlic bits at the end. This is a recipe improvement added in March 2021.</li>
                <li>Salt – I know it sounds like a lot of salt but potatoes need it!</li>
                <li>You can skip this step to transfer the potatoes to a separate tray but you’ll either have to make do with non-crispy-not-really-even-golden potatoes OR golden potatoes with burnt edges and tons of burnt garlic everywhere. You choose… 
                    If you’re ok with less colour, you can leave them in the same pan and keep roasting for another 20 minutes, but don’t let them go too far such that the garlic burns.
                    I like to drizzle the residual garlic pan juices over the potatoes, rather than tossing them, just to preserve the crispy edges. You could in fact just use pan juices without reducing, up to you. This step is also optional. </li>
                <li>Nutrition per serving, slightly over because you actually lose a lot of oil in the pan with the cooking method I use to make them extra crispy.</li>
